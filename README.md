# code-age

This is a script that calculates the average age of your code lines using `git blame` and math.

## Installation

Clone this repo somewhere on your computer:

```
git clone git@github.com:draperunner/code-age.git
```

Create a symbolic link to the `code-age.sh` to some bin folder that's on your path.

```
cd /usr/local/bin
ln -s /path/to/projects/code-age/code-age.sh code-age
```

Now you can run `code-age` anywhere you'd like. Keep it updated by running `git pull` in the repo.
